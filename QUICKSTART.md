## Tips & Tricks

💡 **Nested Components**: Drag components into Container or Form components to create nested layouts

💡 **Auto-Save**: Your work is automatically saved to browser storage - refresh the page and your project will still be there!

💡 **Styling**: Use the Property Panel to customize colors, spacing, and more for each component

💡 **Delete Components**: Select a component and click "Delete Component" in the Property Panel

## Example: Building a Contact Form

1. Drag a **Heading** component → Change text to "Contact Us"
2. Drag a **Form** component below it
3. Drag an **Input** component into the Form → Set label to "Name"
4. Drag another **Input** → Set label to "Email", type to "email"
5. Drag a **Textarea** → Set label to "Message"
6. Drag a **Button** → Change text to "Submit"
7. Preview and Export!

## Troubleshooting

**Components not dragging?**
- Make sure you're clicking and holding on the component in the library
- Drag it over the canvas area before releasing

**Can't see Property Panel?**
- Click on a component first to select it
- The Property Panel only appears when a component is selected

**Preview looks different?**
- Make sure you've saved your changes (they auto-save)
- Try refreshing the preview
